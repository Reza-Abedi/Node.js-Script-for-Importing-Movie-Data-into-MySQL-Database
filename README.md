This Node.js script is designed to read movie data from a JSON file, transform it into a suitable data structure, and subsequently import it into a MySQL database. The script utilizes the 'fs' module to read the JSON file and the 'mysql2' library for interacting with the MySQL database. The specified database schema assumes the existence of a 'movies' database with a 'movies' table containing columns for 'id' (auto-incremented and serving as the primary key), 'title' (a unique title for each movie), and 'description' (a JSON-formatted description of the movie). The script establishes a connection to the database, defines a function for executing queries, and iterates through the movie data, inserting each movie's title and description into the 'movies' table. This script is a practical example of using Node.js to automate the process of populating a MySQL database with movie-related information.
