This script is used to transfer movie data from a JSON file to a MySQL database. It utilizes Node.js along with the 'fs' module for reading the JSON file and the 'mysql2' library for connecting to a MySQL database. The primary purpose is to automate the process of populating a database with movie information, providing a convenient way to manage and query the data within a relational database system. The script can be useful in scenarios where there is a need to store and organize movie-related information in a MySQL database for further analysis, retrieval, or integration with other applications.




Technical Overview:
This Node.js script leverages the 'fs' module to read movie data from a JSON file and utilizes the 'mysql2' library for handling interactions with a MySQL database. The script includes the following key components:

Reading JSON Data:
The 'fs' module is imported to read the contents of the 'movie-data.json' file.
The script reads the JSON string from the file and converts it into a data structure using JSON.parse().

Database Connection:
The script establishes a connection to a MySQL database named 'movies'.
Connection details include the host, port, user, password, and database name. Users should customize these parameters based on their own database setup.

Query Function:
A function named query() is defined to execute SQL queries asynchronously.
It takes an SQL query string and a list of values as parameters and returns the result of the query.

Inserting Data into the Database:
The script iterates through the movie data and logs each movie's details.
For each movie, an SQL query is executed to insert the 'title' and 'description' into the 'movies' table.

Database Schema:
The assumed database schema includes a 'movies' table with columns for 'id' (auto-incremented and serving as the primary key), 'title' (unique title for each movie), and 'description' (JSON-formatted description).

Logging Results:
The script logs the result of each database insertion, providing feedback on the success of the operation.
This script serves as a practical example of automating the process of importing movie-related information into a MySQL database using Node.js. Users can adapt it to their specific use cases and modify the database connection details according to their environment.
